            3. Your Ebiblo Account and Account Security
            </h4>

            <p>
            To use certain features of our Services, you may be required to create an Ebiblo account (an "Account") and provide us with a username, password, 
            and certain other information about yourself as set forth in the <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
            You are solely responsible for the information associated with Your Account and anything 
            that happens related to Your Account. 
            You must maintain the security of your Account and promptly notify Ebiblo 
            if you discover or suspect that someone has accessed your Account without your permission. 
            We recommend that you use a strong password that is used only with the Services.
            </p>

            <p>
            You will not license, sell, or transfer your Account without our prior written approval.

            </p>
            <p>
            You retain any ownership rights you have in

             Your Content in all media formats and channels now known or later developed. 
             This license includes the right for us to make Your Content available for syndication, 
             broadcast, distribution, or publication by other companies, organizations, or individuals 
             who partner with Ebiblo. You also agree that we may remove metadata associated with 
             Your Content, and you irrevocably waive any claims and assertions of moral rights or 
             attribution with respect to Your Content.

            </p>

            <p>

            Any ideas, suggestions, and feedback about Ebiblo or our Services that you provide to us are entirely voluntary, and you agree that Ebiblo may use such ideas, 
            suggestions, and feedback without compensation or obligation to you.
            </p>
            <p>
            Although we have no obligation to screen, edit, or monitor Your Content, we may, in our sole discretion, delete or remove Your Content at any time and for any reason, including for a violation of these Terms, 
            a violation of our Content Policy, or if you otherwise create liability for us.

            7. Ebiblo Content Policy

            </h4>
            <p>
            You are obligated to comply with our Content Policy.
            </p>
            <h5>
            Respect the Platform
            </h5>
            <p>
            Ebiblo includes a vast network of communities that are created, run, and populated by you, the Ebiblo users.
            </p>
            <p>
            Through these communities, you can create notes, comment, discuss, learn, support, and connect with people who share your interests, and we encourage you to find your home on Ebiblo.
            </p>
            <p>
            While not every community may be for you (and you may find some unrelatable or even offensive), no community should be used as a weapon. Communities should create a sense of belonging for their members, not try to diminish it for others. Likewise, everyone on Ebiblo should have an expectation of privacy and safety, so please respect the privacy and safety of others.
            </p>
            <p>
            The platform-wide rules apply to everyone on Ebiblo. These rules are enforced by us.
            </p>

            </h6>
            <p>
            Remember the human. Ebiblo is a place for creating community and belonging, not for attacking marginalized or vulnerable groups of people.

            </h6>
            <p>
            Post authentic content into communities where you have a personal interest, and do not cheat or engage in content manipulation (including spamming, vote manipulation, ban evasion, or subscriber fraud) or otherwise interfere with or disrupt Ebiblo communities.

            Rule 6
            </h6>

            14. Changes to these Terms
            </h4>

            <p>
            We may make changes to these Terms from time to time. If we make changes, we will post the amended Terms to our Services and update the Effective Date above. If the changes, in our sole discretion, are material, we may also notify you by sending an email to the address associated with your Account (if you have chosen to provide an email address) or by otherwise providing notice through our Services. By continuing to access or use the Services on or after the Effective Date of the revised Terms, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms. If you do not agree to the revised Terms, you must stop accessing and using our Services before the changes become effective.

            Because we offer a variety of Services, you may be asked to agree to additional terms before using a specific product or service offered by Ebiblo (“Additional Terms”). To the extent any Additional Terms conflict with these Terms, the Additional Terms rule with respect to your use of the corresponding Service.
